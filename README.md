# content-management-system
This project was done in the Spring of 2018. It uses PHP, bootstrap and a SQLite database in order to manage website content. It also has a control panel in order to add or remove content, such as an image, page content, or an aside. User has the ability to link an aside to zero or many pages.  
# Landing page:

The topic I chose was Web Development. Each category may be nested, with the parent page leading either to the main category or back to Programming.

Once a user is authenticated, based on priveleges, they may add or remove content and manage relationships between content.
